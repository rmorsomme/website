## How do I install R and RStudio?

Here are the webpages to install the two pieces of software R and RStudio:

-   Download and install R 4.1.3 or 4.2.0: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
-   Download and install RStudio Desktop: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/>. The Open Source Edition version is sufficient.

## How can I submit my assignment to Gradescope?

The instructions for submitting your assignment to Gradescope can be found [here](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#submitting_a_pdf). In a nutshell, you'll upload your PDF and them mark the page(s) where each question can be found. It's OK if a question spans multiple pages, just mark them all. It's also OK if a page includes multiple questions.
