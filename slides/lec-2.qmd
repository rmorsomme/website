## Outline

-   Motivating example - stent and stroke
-   Principles of Statistical Inference
-   Types of variable
-   Experiments and observational studies

# Motivating example - stent and stroke

## Example - Stents and strokes

-   Stents are known to reduce the risk of an additional heart attack or death after a cardiac event.
-   Similar benefits for patients at risk of stroke? . . .
-   If so, we can use this well-known procedure to reduce the risk of stroke
-   If not, the procedure (surgery) should be avoided.

## Does the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke?

-   Experiment with 451 at-risk patients
-   Each volunteer patient was randomly assigned to either the treatment (stent) or the control (no stent) group
-   Check with patients 30 days and 365 days later

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r stentStudyResultsDF}
data("stent30")
data("stent365")
stent30_renamed <- stent30 %>% rename(`30 days` = outcome)
stent365_renamed <- stent365 %>% rename(`365 days` = outcome)
stent <- stent30_renamed %>%
  select(-group) %>%
  bind_cols(stent365_renamed) %>% 
  relocate(group) %>%
  mutate(
    group        = fct_rev(group),
    `30 days`    = fct_rev(`30 days`),
    `365 days`   = fct_rev(`365 days`),
  )
stent %>%
  sample_n(5) %>% 
  arrange(group) %>%
  mutate(patient = 1:n()) %>%
  relocate(patient) %>%
  kbl(linesep = "", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Results for five patients from the stent study.",
      align = "llll") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"), 
                latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
                full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1:4, width = "8em")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r stentStudyResultsDFsummary}
stent %>%
  mutate(group = str_to_title(group)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(`30 days`, `365 days`), 
               names_to = "stage", 
               values_to = "outcome") %>%
  count(group, stage, outcome) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(stage, outcome), values_from = n) %>%
  adorn_totals(where = "row") %>%
  kbl(linesep = "", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Descriptive statistics for the stent study.",
      col.names = c("Group", "Stroke", "No event", "Stroke", "No event")) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "30 days" = 2, "365 days" = 2), extra_css = "border-bottom: 2px solid") %>%
  row_spec(1, extra_css = "border-top: 2px solid") %>%
  row_spec(3, extra_css = "border-top: 2px solid") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"), 
                latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))
```

-   Contrary to expectation, we observe more strokes in the treatment group
-   Do the data show a *real* difference between the groups?

## Dealing with Randomness

Suppose I flip a coin $100$ times and count the number of times I obtain heads.

-   I expect to observe *around* $50$ heads
-   Imagine that I observe $85$ heads. That would be alarming; the coin is probably not fair
-   If I had observed $55$ heads then I would not be alarmed; this is a plausible result with a fair coin

. . .

In the stent study, is the observed difference plausible if stents had no effect?

## Intuition about randomness

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Group exercise - gut feeling about randomness

1.  In the coin example, what number of heads would start to make you doubt that the coin is fair?
2.  In the stent study, is the difference large enough to make you doubt that the stents have no effect?

# Principles of Statistical Inference

## Observations and variables

```{r small_sample}
stent %>%
  sample_n(3) %>% 
  arrange(group) %>%
  mutate(patient = 1:n()) %>%
  relocate(patient) %>%
  kbl(linesep = "", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Results for three patients from the stent study.",
      align = "llll") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"), 
                latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
                full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1:4, width = "8em")
```

. . .

-   Each row represents an **observation**
-   Each column represents a **variable**

## Some examples

Observational units: individuals, families, student cohort, cities, counties, countries, cells (biology), animals, books, courses, apples, etc

Variables: height, weight, age, size, year, latitude, longitude, type, sex, diet, number of pages, genre, level, color, etc

## Population, census and sample

-   **Population** of interest
    -   Large, but with well-defined limits
    -   Example: patients at risk of stroke, Duke students, trees in Duke Forest, US counties
    -   Want to investigate the relation between variables

. . .

-   **Census**: collect data on the whole population
    -   typically impractical, expensive

. . .

-   **Sample**: small fraction of the population

## Statistical inference

-   Population **parameter**, e.g. average number of hours Duke students sleep per night
    -   Greek letter: $\mu$, $\beta$, but also $p$.
-   Sample **statistic**, e.g. *observed* average number of hours Duke students sleep per night
    -   Roman letter: $\bar{x}$, $b$, $\hat{p}$

. . .

-   How to learn about the population from a sample?
    -   from sample statistics to population parameters
    -   **Statistical inference** provides a rigorous framework

## Group exercise - observation and variables

1.  Consider a study that investigate the effect of diet on sleep among students at Duke. What is the population? What is the observational unit? Give three variables that you would measure.
2.  Exercise 1.13 a
3.  Exercise 2.7
4.  Give an example of a dataset in your field. What is the population? What are the observational units? What variables are measured?

## Statistics as an art -- sampling

-   There is no need to drink the whole pot (population) to know if the soup is seasoned enough
    -   Tasting a spoonful (sample) is typically sufficient
    -   Such sample is **representative** of the population

![](images/lec-2/soup.png){fig-alt="Illustration of a bowl of soup" fig-align="center" width="300"}

## 

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Group exercise - sampling

Back to the study on the effect of diet on sleep among Duke students. How would you obtain a sample of student for your study if you had (i) 1 hour, (ii) 1 week?
:::

```{r, echo = F}
countdown(minutes = 2)
```

## 

What can go wrong?

-   small sample
-   convenience sampling, e.g. students on campus
-   blind spots, e.g. voters with no phone
-   ...

## 

The gold standard is a **random sample**

-   but even then, we can have non-response bias

. . .

ðŸ›‘ Obtaining a representative sample is difficult.

âœ… But surprisingly small samples can do the job!

-   e.g. 1,500 for a whole country (later in class)

## Sampling is natural {.smaller}

-   When you taste a spoonful of soup and decide the spoonful you tasted isn't salty enough, that's exploratory analysis
-   If you generalize and conclude that your entire soup needs salt, that's an inference
-   For your inference to be valid, the spoonful you tasted (the sample) needs to be representative of the entire pot (the population)

# Types of variable

## Numerical variables

-   Takes a numerical value
-   Examples: age, height, number of children

. . .

-   Not all numbers are numerical variables, e.g. zip code, phone number
-   Heuristic: is the average meaningful? Yes

. . .

-   Discrete, or continuous; not always clear cut

## Categorical variables

-   Takes a level (a category)
-   Examples: eye color, place of birth, education level

. . .

-   May be numbers, e.g. zip code, phone number
-   Heuristic: is the average meaningful? No

. . .

-   Ordinal, or nominal

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Exercise 1.13 b
2.  Consider the dataset you proposed in point 3 of the previous group exercise. Can you identify a numerical and a categorical variable? What are they?
3.  Does you dataset contain a variable of each of the four types? Can you come up with a variable of each type?

# Experiments and observational studies

## Relationship between variables

-   Two variables can either be independent or associated.

-   Association can be linear (positive, or negative) but it can take any form.

## 

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Group exercise - types of associations

1.  Provide two numerical variables that are likely to be linearly associated. Is the association positive or negative?
2.  Provide two numerical variable that are likely to be associated in a non linear way e.g. U-shape, inverted-J-shape (like a square root).
:::

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 3)
```

## Explanatory and response variable

-   When two variables are associated, we sometimes hypothesize that changes in one result in changes in the other.

. . .

-   Explanatory variable $\Rightarrow$ response variable

. . .

-   ...but association $\neq$ causation; examples:
    -   fire, damage and firemen; ice-cream and shark attack
    -   counties and kidney cancer death rate; the best classrooms are small classrooms.

## Experiments

-   The value of the explanatory variable is **assigned** by the researcher
-   **Randomized** experiment: the value of the explanatory variable is randomly assigned
    -   removes any counfounding (luking) variable
-   **Blind**, or even double-blind, to avoid biases
    -   placebo
    -   can go wrong, e.g. vitamins in prison

------------------------------------------------------------------------

âœ… Experiments lead to causal claims; gold standard

. . .

But experiments are not always applicable:

-   not all variables can be assigned, e.g. age
-   ethical considerations, e.g. smoking cigarette, sham surgery (placebo)
-   practical consideration, e.g. red meat consumption

## Observational Studies

-   The value of the explanatory variable is **not assigned** by the researcher
    -   there is no interference
-   Example: survey

. . .

ðŸ›‘ Does not easily lead to causal claims due to the potential presence of counfounding variables

You want to investigate the effect of caffeine on class participation among students at Duke

1.  Design an observational study.
2.  Design an experiment.
3.  Is your experiment double-blind? Can you make it double-blind?
4.  Any ethical or practical concern with the experiment?

Provide an example of an observational study that you would not turn into an experiment due to:

1.  practical considerations
2.  ethical considerations
