# Data analysis and statistics

## What is data analysis?

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
> "**Data analysis** is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of **discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making**. (...) In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively."
:::

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis)

## Statistics

> "Every field worth studying connects to one's everyday life. Statistics is not an isolated field, it connects to everything." --- Andrew Gelman

. . .

**Statistical inference**: set of procedures for making **rigorous** claims about a population from a (small) sample in the presence of uncertainty.

## Course FAQ

::: incremental
-   **What background is assumed for the course?** There is no prerequisite.
-   **Will we be doing coding?** Yes. We will use `R`.
-   **What if I have never coded?** We do not expect students to have any experience with R or any other programming language.
-   **Will we learn the mathematical theory of statistics?** Yes and no. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of hypothesis testing and simple linear regression.
:::

## Course learning objectives

-   Become a critical consumer of statistical analyses.
-   Summarize and visualize categorical and continuous data.
-   Build and investigate linear regression models for forecasting.
-   Conduct hypothesis tests and construct confidence intervals for proportions, means, and regression coefficients
-   Plan and complete a statistical analysis of a real-world phenomenon.

## Examples of data analyses in practice

## Activities: Prepare, Participate, Practice, Perform {.smaller}

-   **Prepare:** Prepare for lectures by completing the readings.
-   **Participate:** Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, office hours, team meetings
-   **Practice:** Solve plenty of exercises; this is the *best* way to learn statistics.
-   **Perform:** Put together what you've learned to analyze real-world data
    -   Frequent homework assignments
    -   Prediction group project
    -   Inference group project

::: callout-tip
## Tip for practicing

In the IMS book, the solutions of the odd-numbered exercises are provided in the appendix.
:::

## Cadence - homework

-   two sets of homework per week

-   combination of problems from IMS and lab exercises

-   due dates TBD

-   typed up using RMarkdown and submitted as a PDF on Gradescope

-   lowest grade dropped

-   you may discuss homework with other students; however, your answers should be completed and submitted individually

## Cadence - two group projects {.smaller}

-   **Prediction project**:
    -   groups of 2
    -   goal: build a model that makes the most accurate predictions possible.
    -   some lab and lecture time dedicated to working on it
    -   2-page write up and informal presentation (2 slides)

. . .

-   **Inference project:**
    -   groups of 2
    -   goal: analyze a phenomenon of your choice using real-world data
    -   apply all the techniques learned in class (visualization, hypothesis test, confidence interval and linear regression)
    -   some lab and lecture time dedicated to working on it
    -   5-page report and formal presentation (+-10 slides)

## Teams

-   Team assignments
    -   assigned by me
    -   in-class exercises, and the two project
-   Expectations and roles
    -   everyone is expected to contribute equal *effort*
    -   everyone is expected to understand *all* code turned in

## Grading {.smaller}

| Category           | Percentage |
|--------------------|------------|
| Homework and Labs  | 50%        |
| Prediction Project | 20%        |
| Inference Project  | 30%        |

See [course syllabus](https://rmorsomme.github.io/website/course-syllabus.html) for how the final letter grade will be determined.

## Diversity + inclusion {.smaller}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

::: incremental
-   If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let us know!
-   Please let us know your preferred pronouns; correct us if necessary.
-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.
-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
:::

## Accessibility

-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always learning how to do this better. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.

# Course policies

## COVID policies

-   Wear a mask at all times!

-   Read and follow university guidance [here](https://coronavirus.duke.edu/).

## Late work, waivers, regrades policy

-   We have policies!
-   to ensure timely feedback, assignments submitted after the deadline will not be graded
-   **one** waiver available for a 24-hour extension
-   regrade requests within 48 hours
-   Read the [course syllabus](https://rmorsomme.github.io/website/course-syllabus.html) for more details

## Collaboration policy

-   Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.

-   Homeworks must be completed individually. You may **not** directly share answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.

## Sharing / reusing code policy

-   We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted

-   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may use any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).

-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source

## Academic integrity

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
>
> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
>
> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and

2.  ask questions *quickly*; don't let a day pass by with lingering questions;
3.  do the homework assignments thoroughly;
4.  practice, practice, practice;
5.  don't procrastinate; start on the homework assignments and the projects early.
