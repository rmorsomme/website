# Data analysis and statistics

## What is data analysis?

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
> "**Data analysis** is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of **discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making**. (...) In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively."
:::

## Statistics

> "Every field worth studying connects to one's everyday life. Statistics is not an isolated field, it connects to everything." --- Andrew Gelman

. . .

**Statistical inference**: set of procedures for making rigorous claims about a population from a (small) sample thereof in the presence of uncertainty.

## Course FAQ

::: incremental
-   **What background is assumed for the course?** There is no prerequisite.
-   **Will we be doing coding?** Yes. We will use R.
-   **What if I have never coded?** We do not expect students to have any experience with R or any other programming languages.
-   **Will we learn the mathematical theory of statistics?** Yes and no. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of hypothesis testing and simple linear regression.
:::

## Course learning objectives

-   Become a critical consumer of statistical analyses.
-   Summarize and visualize categorical and continuous data.
-   Build and investigate linear regression models for forecasting.
-   Conduct hypothesis tests and construct confidence intervals for proportions, means, and regression coefficients
-   Plan and complete a statistical analysis of a real-world phenomenon.

## Examples of data analyses in practice

## Activities: Prepare, Participate, Practice, Perform {.smaller}

-   **Prepare:** Prepare for lectures by completing the readings.
-   **Participate:** Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, office hours, team meetings
-   **Practice:** Solve plenty of exercises; this is the *best* way to learn statistics. The solutions of the odd-numbered exercises of the book are provided in the appendix.
-   **Perform:** Put together what you've learned to analyze real-world data
    -   Frequent homework and lab assignments
    -   Prediction group project
    -   Inference group project

## Cadence

::: incremental
-   **HWs/labs:** Posted TBD morning, due following TBD 9pm
-   **Two projects:** Deadlines throughout the semester, with some lab and lecture time dedicated to working on them, and most work done in teams outside of class
:::

## Teams

-   Team assignments
    -   Assigned by me
    -   in-class exercises, and the two project
-   Expectations and roles
    -   Everyone is expected to contribute equal *effort*
    -   Everyone is expected to understand *all* code turned in

## Grading {.smaller}

| Category           | Percentage |
|--------------------|------------|
| Homework and Labs  | 50%        |
| Prediction Project | 20%        |
| Inference Project  | 30%        |

See [course syllabus](https://sta101-suI22.github.io/website/course-syllabus.html) for how the final letter grade will be determined.

## Support

-   Attend office hours.
-   Ask questions in class *quickly*.
-   Read the [course support](https://sta101-ssI22.github.io/website/course-support.html) page.

## Announcements

-   Posted on Sakai (Announcements tool) and sent via email, be sure to check both regularly
-   I'll assume that you've read an announcement by the next "business" day

## Diversity + inclusion {.smaller}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

::: incremental
-   If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let us know!
-   Please let us know your preferred pronouns. You'll also be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.
-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.
-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
:::

## Accessibility

-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always learning how to do this better. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.

# Course policies

## COVID policies

-   Wear a mask at all times!

-   Read and follow university guidance

## Late work, waivers, regrades policy

-   We have policies!
-   Read about them on the [course syllabus](https://sta101-suI22.github.io/website/course-syllabus.html) and refer back to them when you need it

## Collaboration policy

-   Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.

-   Homeworks must be completed individually. You may **not** directly share answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.

## Sharing / reusing code policy

-   We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted

-   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).

-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source

## Academic integrity

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
>
> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
>
> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
>
> -   I will act if the Standard is compromised.

## Most importantly!

Ask if you're not sure if something violates a policy!

# Making STA 101 a success

## Five tips for success

1.  Complete the reading before the lectures.
2.  Ask questions *quickly*. Don't let a day pass by with lingering questions.
3.  Do the homework and lab.
4.  Practice, practice, practice.
5.  Don't procrastinate. Start on the HW/lab assignments and the projects early.

## Learning during a pandemic, learning during the summer

I want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don't hesitate to ask.

::: incremental
-   You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you're always welcome to talk to me. If I can't help, I likely know someone who can.
-   I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this summer session
:::

## This week's tasks

-   Download and install R and RStudio.
-   Complete the Getting to know you survey if you haven't yet done so!
-   Read the syllabus
-   Watch out for next announcement emails
