## 7 Billion: Are You Typical?

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Group exercise - data summaries?

1.  What variables are mentioned in the video?
2.  What are their types?
3.  How were they summarized and/or visualized?
:::

```{r, echo = F}
countdown(minutes = 2)
```

# Visualization for numerical data

## US birth data

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(fivethirtyeight) # for the USbirth dataset
d_birth <- fivethirtyeight::US_births_2000_2014
```

There are `r nrow(d_birth)` observations (rows)

```{r}
nrow(d_birth) # number of rows
```

and `r ncol(d_birth)` variables (columns)

```{r}
ncol(d_birth) # number of columns
```

## 

```{r}
head(d_birth)
library(tidyverse)       # for data wrangling
glimpse(d_birth)
```

## Histogram

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2"
ggplot(d_birth) +
  geom_histogram(aes(births)) +
  labs(title = "Daily number of natural births in the US between 2000 and 2014")
```

## 

-   Higher bars indicate where the data are relatively more common
-   More days with around 8,000 births or with around 12,500 births
-   Few days with less than 7,000 or more than 14,000 births.
-   Also few days with around 10,000 births

We can change the number of bins to have a rougher or more detailed histogram.

## 

::: panel-tabset
## bins = 10

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(d_birth) +
  geom_histogram(aes(births), bins = 10)
```

## bins = 100

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(d_birth) +
  geom_histogram(aes(births), bins = 100)
```
:::

## Statistics as an art - describing a distribution {.smaller}

::: callout-tip
To explore a numerical variable, always start with a histogram
:::

To describe the distribution of a numerical variable, we comment on

-   the mode(s): unimodal, bimodal, multimodal
-   the shape of each mode: flat, bell-shape, bounded
-   the symmetry: symmetric, left skewed, right skewed
-   the outliers: presence of extreme values
-   any other surprising feature.

::: callout-note
## Describing a distribution is an art

Note that some distributions will not fit nicely in these categories.
:::

## Describing the US birth data

The distribution of the daily number of births in the US is **bimodal** with each mode being **bell-shaped** and **symmetric**. We observe **no extreme value**.

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
#| echo: false
ggplot(d_birth) +
  geom_histogram(aes(births), bins = 100)
```

## 

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Group exercise - describing a distribution

Describe the distributions in exercises 5.6, 5.13, 5.24 and 5.26 (only consider the histograms)
:::

```{r, echo = F}
countdown(minutes = 4)
```

## Scatterplots

**Histograms**: visualize the distribution of a **single** numerical variable.

. . .

**Scatterplots**: visualize the relation between **two** numerical variables.

## The `mpg` dataset

```{r}
d_car <- ggplot2::mpg
head(d_car)
```

We will look at the relation between engine size (`disp`) and fuel efficiency (`hwy`).

## 

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2"
ggplot(d_car) +
  geom_point(aes(displ, hwy)) +
  labs(title = "Relation between fuel consumption on the highway and engine size")
```

## 

::: callout-note
To add an additional variable to your visualization, you can use color or symbols.
:::

## 

::: panel-tabset
## Colored points

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(d_car) +
  geom_point(aes(displ, hwy, col = drv))
```

## Symbols

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(d_car) +
  geom_point(aes(displ, hwy, shape = drv))
```
:::

# Summary for numerical data

## Measures of centrality {.smaller}

-   The **average**: $\bar{x} = \dfrac{x_1 + \dots + x_n}{n}$
    -   To compute the average age in the class, we would calculate

$$
\overline{\text{age}} = \dfrac{\text{age}_{Hayden} + \text{age}_{Janice} + \text{age}_{Kenndy} + \text{age}_{Maggie} + \text{age}_{Melissa} + \text{age}_{Yuanzhi}}{6}
$$

-   The **median**: the middle value
    -   50% of the sample is large than the median, and 50% is smaller.

. . .

```{r}
mean(d_birth$births)   # average
median(d_birth$births) # median
```

## Percentiles

Percentiles are a generalization of the median.

. . .

The value that is larger than p% of the data and smaller than the rest is called the **p-th percentile**.

. . .

The median is the *50th* percentile.

. . .

We will soon make use of the **25th** and **75th percentiles**.

Later in the course, the 95th and 97.5th percentiles will also be useful.

## Measures of variation

-   **Variance**: average *squared* distance from the mean
    -   **Standard deviation** (sd): square root of the variance (roughly speaking, the average distance to the mean)
    -   Most (+- 95%) of the data is within 2 sd of the mean.
-   **Inter-quartile range** (IQR): distance between the 25th and the 75th percentiles.

. . .

```{r}
var(d_birth$births) # variance
sd(d_birth$births) # sd
IQR(d_birth$births) # iqr
```

## Robustness

Real-world data often contain **extreme** values

-   measurement errors,
-   typos,
-   extreme observations,
-   ...

The average, median, variance, sd and iqr are not equally **robust** to the presence of extreme values.

## 

Let us contaminate the birth data with an extreme value of 1 billion...

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2"
x_uncontaminated <- d_birth$births  
x_contaminated   <- c(x_uncontaminated, 1e9) # 1e9 = 10^9 (scientific notation)
```

. . .

...and compare the mean, median, variance, sd and iqr of these two variables.

## 

```{r}
summary(x_uncontaminated)
summary(x_contaminated)
```

. . .

```{r}
var(x_uncontaminated); var(x_contaminated)
sd(x_uncontaminated); sd(x_contaminated)
IQR(x_uncontaminated); IQR(x_contaminated)
```

##

::: callout-warning
## Robustness of the median and the iqr

While the **median and iqr are robust** to the presence of extreme values, the mean, variance and sd are not.

# Summary for categorical data

## Proportion table (2d)

## Group exercise - contigency and proportion table

1.  What does the number $12$ (2nd row, 1st column) represent in the contigency table?
2.  What does the number $0.05$ (2nd row, 1st column) represent in the first proportion table?
3.  What does the number $0.25$ (2nd row, 1st column) represent in the row proportion table?
:::

```{r, echo = F}

# Visualization for categorical data

## Barplot

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(d_car) +
  geom_bar(aes(drv))
```

. . .

We can add a second categorical variable using colors.

## Advanced barplots

::: panel-tabset
## stacked

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(d_car) +
  geom_bar(aes(drv, fill = class))
```

## dodged

#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(d_car) +
  geom_bar(aes(drv, fill = class), position = "dodge")
```

## standardized

#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(d_car) +
  geom_bar(aes(drv, fill = class), position = "fill")

## Group exercise - pros and cons of barplots

Exercise [4.5](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/explore-numerical.html#chp4-exercises)
:::

```{r, echo = F}
countdown(minutes = 3)
```

# Advanced visualizations

## Faceted histograms

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2,3|4"

d_birth_small <- filter(d_birth, year %in% c(2000, 2004, 2009, 2014))
ggplot(d_birth_small) +
  geom_histogram(aes(births)) + 
  facet_grid(year~.)
```

## 

::: callout-tip
## Beyond 2 variables

Faceted figures are a great way to include $\ge$ 3 variables! See exercise [1.13](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-hello.html)
:::

## Mosaic plot

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(d_car) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(drv), fill = class))
```

. . .

✅ Combines the strengths of the various barplots.

🛑 Not in the tool box of every data scientist

## Boxplots

![From raw data to boxplot](images/lec-3/EDA-boxplot.png)

Source: [R 4 Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)

##  {.smaller}

-   The thick line in the middle of the box indicates the median;

-   the box stretches from the 25th percentile (Q1) to the 75th percentile (Q3); it covers 50% of the data;

-   the length of the whiskers are at most 1.5 iqr;

-   any observation more than 1.5 iqr away from the box is labelled as an outlier;

. . .

-   more compact than histograms

. . .

::: callout-note
## Outliers

Outliers have an extreme value. How to deal with an outlier depends on why the observation stands out. outliers can be

-   removed
-   corrected
-   ignored

# Effective communication

## Statistics as an art - figures {.smaller}

-   Have a **purpose**: is the figure necessary?

. . .

-   **Parsimony**: keep it simple and avoid distractions

. . .

-   Tell a **story**: provide context and interpret the figure

. . .

-   **At least 3 variables** as often as possible: color, shape, facets, etc.

. . .

-   **Edit** your figure: title, axes, theme, etc.

. . .

📋 See [R for Data Science - chapters 3 and 7](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) for more on data visualization in R.
