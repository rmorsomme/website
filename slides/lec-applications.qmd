## 7 billion -- are you typical?

This [short video](https://youtu.be/4B2xOvKFFz4) by **National Geographic** illustrates the various ways in which demographic variables can be summarized.

## 200 years of history through health and wealth {.smaller}

This [short video](https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo) and this [Ted talk](https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo) show the work of the public health scientist **Hans Rosling** who uses data visualization with great skills to tell a story.

Can you identify all 5 variables that were necessary to make the animation in the short video? Visit the [Gapminder website](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles&url=v1) to explore other variables.

Learn about Dr. **Ivana Seric**'s work for the Philadelphia 76ers in this [short video](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw). She has used her mathematical background and passion for basketball to dive in the data and help the NBA team devise better strategies.

## When data seem to contradict widely held believes

In this [Ted talk](https://youtu.be/um5gMZcZWm0), Prof. Steven Levitt argues that the data do not seem to corroborate the idea that car seats are no more effective than seat belts in protecting kids from dying in cars.

## Statistics in psychiatry and agriculture

Hear about the work of the statistician [Susan Murphy](https://youtu.be/Bz0e5xGDHaU) and agricultural ecologist [David Lobell](https://youtu.be/Bz0e5xGDHaU), both recipients of the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship.

Believe it or not, agriculture is where statistical methods (experiments, hypothesis tests, etc) were first used during the 1920s.

## Estimating the effect of commute time on rent in New York {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="32%"}
In this [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorkers-will-pay-56-a-month-to-trim-a-minute-off-their-commute/), Carl Bialik looked at more than 100,000 homes present on StreetEasy. He observed that, unsurprisingly, the distance to the nearest metro does impact rent prices, and he even managed to put a number on that effect: \$56/minute.
