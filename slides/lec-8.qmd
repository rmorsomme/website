# Statistical inference

## Learning about a proportion

example

## Point estimate

**parameter of interest**: proportion in the population

**sample statistic**: sample proportion

It seems natural to use the sample proportion as an estimate for the population proportion.

## Limitation of point estimate

A single point does not indicate how confident we are in our estimation.

-   If we have a *large* sample, then we can be pretty confident that our estimate will likely be close to the true value fo the parameter,

-   if we have a *small* sample, then we know that our estimate may be far from the truth.

-   e.g. basketball free throws, ratings on Yelp or Amazon

## Statistical inference

Framework to make rigorous statements about uncertainty in our estimates

-   confidence intervals

    -   "we are 90% confident that the interval $(20\%, 30\%)$ captures the true value of the population proportion".

-   hypothesis tests

    -   "we reject the claim that the population proportion is $50\%$".

# Five cases

## Single proportion  {.smaller}

What is the proportion of vegetarian among Duke students?

. . .

**Population parameter**: proportion of vegetarian among Duke students ($p$)

**sample statistics**: proportion of vegetarian in the sample $\hat{p}$

. . .

Confidence interval: $(0.31, 0.43)$

-   we are 95% confident that the interval $(0.31, 0.43)$ capture the proportion of vegetarian among Duke students.

. . .

Hypothesis test: is the proportion of vegetarian among Duke students $0.5$?

-   $H_0:p=0.5, H_a:p\neq0.5$

-   The data collected provide strong evidence against $H_0$, that is, against the hypothesis that half od Duke students are vegetarian.

## Difference between two proportions  {.smaller}

Is the proportion of vegetarian the same among undergraduate Duke student and graduate Duke students?

**Population parameter**: difference between the proportion of vegetarian among undergraduate Duke students and graduate Duke students ($p_{diff} = p_{undergrad}-p_{grad}$)

**sample statistics**: different in proportion of vegetarian in the sample $\hat{p}_{diff} = \hat{p}_{undergrad} - \hat{p}_{grad}$

. . .

Confidence interval: $(-0.05, 0.08)$

-   we are 95% confident that the interval $(-0.05, 0.08)$ capture the true value of $p_{diff}$.

. . .

Hypothesis test: is the proportion of vegetarian the same among undergraduate and graduate Duke students?

-   $H_0:p_{diff}=0.5, H_a:p_{diff}\neq0.5$

-   The data collected do not provide strong evidence against $H_0$, that is, against the hypothesis that $p_{diff}=0.5$.

## Single mean

How much time do Duke students sleep on average per night?

## Difference between two proportions

Do undergraduate Duke students sleep the same mount of time per night as graduate Duke students do?
