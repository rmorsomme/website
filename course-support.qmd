title: "Course support"
---

Most of you will need help at some point and we want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help. This is especially important in a summer class.

## Lectures and labs

If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

## Office hours

The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours during the times posted on the home page to ask questions about the course content and assignments. A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. I encourage each and every one of you to take advantage of this resource! Make a pledge to stop by office hours at least once during the first week of class. If you truly have no questions to ask, just stop by and say hi and introduce yourself. You can find a list of everyone's office hours [here](/course-team.html).

## Email
You can email Dr. Raphael Morsomme at [rnm16\@duke.edu](mailto:rnm16@duke.edu). **please include "STA 101" in the subject line.** Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to STA101L emails within 24 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.

## Academic support

There are times you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In those instances, I encourage you to visit the **Academic Resource Center**. The [Academic Resource Center (ARC)](https://arc.duke.edu) offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke. Services include Learning Consultations, Peer Tutoring and Study Groups, ADHD/LD Coaching, Outreach Workshops, and more. Because learning is a process unique to every individual, they work with each student to discover and develop their own academic strategy for success at Duke. ARC services are available free to any Duke undergraduate student, in any year, studying in any discipline. Contact the ARC to schedule an appointment. Undergraduates in any year, studying any discipline can benefit! Contact [theARC\@duke.edu](mailto:theARC@duke.edu), 919-684-5917.

## Mental health and wellness

Student mental health and wellness is of primary importance at Duke, and the university offers resources to support students in managing daily stress and self-care. Duke offers several resources for students to seek assistance on coursework and to nurture daily habits that support overall well-being, some of which are listed below:
