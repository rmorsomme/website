    "text": "Overview\nWelcome to STA101L Data Analysis and Statistical Inference. The goal of this class is to prepare you to be critical consumers of statistical analyses in your scientific fields of practice and future professions. Our point of departure will be to think about data collection: how to (not) collect data, and how the way in which data are collected impacts the analysis that we conduct. We will then quickly delve into data visualization. Ever heard of a mozaic plot or an inter-quartile range? This is an area of data analysis where creativity and an eye for good design can make a difference. Once we have good grasp of how to visualize data, we will construct statistical models to make predictions and to understand the relations that exist between variables.\nWhile models can be useful (especially if their predictions are accurate!), all models are inherently wrong. The statistical tests that we will learn in the second half of the course will help us quantify how (un)certain we are that the models we construct pick up real patterns in the data and not just background noise.\nThroughout the class, you will attend hands-on labs in which you will learn to implement all these techniques in the statistical computing software R."

In these homework assignments, you will apply what you‚Äôve learned during lectures and labs to show conceptual understanding of the content and complete data analysis tasks in R. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Homework must be typed up using RMarkdown and submitted as a PDF on Gradescope.\nThe homework assignment with the lowest grade will be dropped at the end of the term.\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be two group projects. Through these, you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you‚Äôve learned in the course thus far. The projects will focus on the two pillars of statistics and data science: prediction and inference. In the first project, you will construct a regression model for prediction. The goal will be to build a model that provides predictions that are as accurate as possible. In the second project, you will analyze a phenomenon that interests you using real-world data.

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic integrity\nDon‚Äôt cheat!\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard (DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard:\nStudents affirm their commitment to uphold the values of the Duke University community by signing a pledge that states:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;\nI will act if the Standard is compromised\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow Duke policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one‚Äôs own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects. Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. If you have any questions about how to follow these requirements, please contact Jeanna McCullers (jeanna.mccullers@duke.edu), Director of the Office of Student Conduct.\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what‚Äôs the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the TA.\nFor the projects, collaboration between teams at a high level is also allowed; however, you may not share code or components of the project with other teams.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. You may make use of any online resources (e.g.¬†RStudio Community, StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On homework assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on the projects you may not directly share code with another team.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. Given the fast pace of a summer class, any assignment submitted after the deadline will not be graded. The homework assignments will be published early to give you ample time to work on them. Note that the lowest homework will be dropped.\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Raphael Morsomme and our TA Rohit Roy before the deadline to obtain a 24-hour extension. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let a member of the instruction team know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade request policy\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within 48 hours of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the inference project report is due.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend. More details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this term. Lab time is dedicated to working on your lab assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. If you know you‚Äôre going to miss a lab session and you‚Äôre feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others‚Äô time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nAttendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university‚Äôs top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have symptoms related to COVID-19, have had a known exposure to COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health at 919-681-9355. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\nPlease read and follow university guidance here. The current guidelines are for students and instructors to wear masks during class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nPolicy on video recording course content\nIf you feel that you need record the lectures, you must get permission from the instructor ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, no for distribution. The full policy on recording of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available at provost.duke.edu/sites/default/files/FHB_App_P.pdf. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board."

    "text": "Data\nWe will work with the natality data for the U.S. in 2020. The response variable that we are interested in is newborn‚Äôs weight. This variable is important to medical professionals since a newborn with a low birth weight is more likely to require additional care. You have access to a random sample of 1,000 observations to construct your prediction model. I have kept a separate set of 20,000 observations to evaluate the prediction model that you select.\nHere is a detailed overview of the variable\n\nnewborn_birth_weight: newborn birth weight in grams (response)\nmonth: birth month (1 = January, ‚Ä¶, 12 = December)\nmother_age: age of the mother in years\n\nprenatal_care_starting_month: month in which prenatal care began; if 0, there was no prenatal care\n\ndaily_cigarette_prepregnancy: daily number of cigarettes smoked before the pregnancy\ndaily_cigarette_trimester_1: daily number of cigarettes smoked during the 1st trimester of the pregnancy\ndaily_cigarette_trimester_2: daily number of cigarettes smoked during the 2nd trimester of the pregnancy\ndaily_cigarette_trimester_3: daily number of cigarettes smoked during the 3rd trimester of the pregnancy\nmother_height: height of the mother in inches\nmother_bmi: body mass index of the mother\nmother_weight_prepregnancy: weight of the mother before the pregnancy in pounds\nmother_weight_delivery: weight of the mother at delivery in pounds\nmother_diabetes_gestational: whether the mother had diabetes during the pregnancy\nnewborn_sex: sex of the newborn\ngestation_week: number of gestational weeks\nmother_risk_factors: whether the mother had any risk factor (diabetes, hypertension, previous preterm birth, previous cesarean, infertility treatment used, etc)"

    "title": "Prediction project",
    "section": "Submission",
    "text": "Submission\nThe three primary deliverables for this project are:\n\nPrediction model: you need to submit a RDATA file that contains your prediction model. The prediction model must consist in a function that takes a test set (a dataframe with the same predictors as the training set, but no response variable) as an input and returns a prediction for each observation of the test set. The RDATA file should not contain anything else.\nInformal presentation: you will present your work orally to rest of the class. The presentation should be no longer than 5 minutes (aim for 2-6 slides). It is fine if the presentation is shorter than 5 minutes, but it cannot exceed 5 minutes. The two team members should speak roughly the same amount of time. Each presentation will be followed by a short QA session.\nFinal report: The final report details your work. It needs to be realized using RMarkdown and submitted on Gradescope as a PDF. The RMD file also needs to be sent via email to the instruction team (reproducibility). The page limit is 6 pages (including code chunks, but excluding the appendix). Figures should go in the appendix, along with any work that you wish to include. Grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report."
