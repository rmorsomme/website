## Problem set (19 points)

-   9.8 (3 points)

For the remaining exercises, use the birth data set

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(readr)
d <- read_csv("https://rmorsomme.github.io/website/projects/training_set.csv")
```

## Confidence intervals via bootstrap (14 points)

Construct (7 points) and interpret in the context of the problem (1 point) a 95% confidence interval using 10000 bootstrap samples for

-   the difference in proportion of female newborns among women with and without risk factor (7 points)

-   the difference in the mean weight of newborns among women with and without risk factor (7 points)

## Hypothesis test via simulation (16 points)

Conduct a hypothesis test using simulation for the following cases. State the hypotheses in words and in mathematical symbols (2 points) and use 10000 samples simulated samples and the significance level $\alpha=0.05$ (6 points).

-   You want to determine whether women with and without risk factor have the same proportion of female newborns (8 points)

-   You want to determine whether women with and without risk factor have newborns with the same mean weight (8 points)

## Reproducibility (1 point)

A seed is set with the command `set.seed` before any code with a stochastic component.
