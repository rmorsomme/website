Any pages that are not marked will **not** be graded.\n\n    -   Make sure that your uploaded PDF document matches your `.qmd` and the PDF in your GitHub repository exactly. Points will be deducted for documents that are not reproducible.\n\n# Grading (50 pts)\n\n| **Part**                             | **Points** |\n|:-------------------------------------|:----------:|\n| **Part 1 - Conceptual** (on Sakai)   |     10     |\n| **Part 2 - Applied** (on Gradescope) |     40     |\n| **Total**                            |     50     |",
