Feel free to re-use the template provided for HW1.\n\nWhen submitting your work on Gradescope, please assign a page for each question.\n\n## Problem set (10 points)\n\n-   9.2 -- parts b and d (1 point)\n-   9.4 (4 points) -- Hint: use the symbol `$` to write mathematical equations; for instance, to write the fraction $\\frac{e^{\\mu}}{\\beta_0}$ simply use `$\\frac{e^{\\mu}}{\\beta_0}$`.\n-   9.8 (3 points)\n-   24.8 -- parts b-c with a **percentile** bootstrap interval, the usual bootstrap interval that we have constructed in class (2 points)\n\nFor the remaining exercises, use the birth data set\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\nd <- read_csv(\"https://rmorsomme.github.io/website/projects/training_set.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n## Confidence intervals via bootstrap (18 points)\n\nConstruct (5 points) and interpret in the context of the problem (1 point) a 95% confidence interval using 10000 bootstrap samples for\n\n-   the proportion of female newborn (6 points)\n\n-   the mean weight of newborns (6 points)\n\n-   the slope of `gestation week` in a simple linear regression model for `newborn_birth_weight` (6 points)\n\n## Hypothesis test via simulation (21 points)\n\nConduct a hypothesis test using simulation for the following cases. State the hypotheses in words and in mathematical symbols (2 points) and use 10000 samples simulated samples and the significance level $\\alpha=0.05$ (5 points).\n\n-   You want to determine whether exactly half of the newborns are female (7 points)\n\n-   You want to determine whether the mean weight of newborns is 3500 grams (7 points)\n\n-   You want to determine whether `newborn_birth_weight` is independent of `gestation week` (7 points)\n\n## Reproducibility (1 point)\n\nA seed is set with the command `set.seed` before any code with a stochastic component.",
