State the hypotheses in words and in mathematical symbols (2 points) and use 10000 samples simulated samples and the significance level $\\alpha=0.05$ (5 points).\n\n-   You want to determine whether women with and without risk factor have the same proportion of female newborns (7 points)\n\n-   You want to determine whether women with and without risk factor have newborns with the same mean weight (7 points)\n\n## Reproducibility (1 point)\n\nA seed is set with the command `set.seed` before any code with a stochastic component.",
