Feel free to re-use the template provided for HW1.\n\nWhen submitting your work on Gradescope, please assign a page for each question.\n\n## Problem set (19 points)\n\n-   9.8 (3 points)\n\nFor the remaining exercises, use the birth data set\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\nd <- read_csv(\"https://rmorsomme.github.io/website/projects/training_set.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n## Confidence intervals via bootstrap (14 points)\n\nConstruct (7 points) and interpret in the context of the problem (1 point) a 95% confidence interval using 10000 bootstrap samples for\n\n-   the difference in proportion of female newborns among women with and without risk factor (7 points)\n\n-   the difference in the mean weight of newborns among women with and without risk factor (7 points)\n\n## Hypothesis test via simulation (16 points)\n\nConduct a hypothesis test using simulation for the following cases. State the hypotheses in words and in mathematical symbols (2 points) and use 10000 samples simulated samples and the significance level $\\alpha=0.05$ (6 points).\n\n-   You want to determine whether women with and without risk factor have the same proportion of female newborns (8 points)\n\n-   You want to determine whether women with and without risk factor have newborns with the same mean weight (8 points)\n\n## Reproducibility (1 point)\n\nA seed is set with the command `set.seed` before any code with a stochastic component.",
