(...) In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.\"\n:::\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis)\n\n## Statistics\n\n> \"Every field worth studying connects to one's everyday life. Statistics is not an isolated field, it connects to everything.\" --- Andrew Gelman\n\n. . .\n\n**Statistical inference**: set of procedures for making **rigorous** claims about a population from a (small) sample in the presence of uncertainty.\n\n## Course FAQ\n\n::: incremental\n-   **What background is assumed for the course?** There is no prerequisite.\n-   **Will we be doing coding?** Yes. We will use `R`.\n-   **What if I have never coded?** We do not expect students to have any experience with R or any other programming language.\n-   **Will we learn the mathematical theory of statistics?** Yes and no. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of hypothesis testing and simple linear regression.\n:::\n\n## Course learning objectives\n\n-   Become a critical consumer of statistical analyses.\n-   Summarize and visualize categorical and continuous data.\n-   Build and investigate linear regression models for forecasting.\n-   Conduct hypothesis tests and construct confidence intervals for proportions, means, and regression coefficients\n-   Plan and complete a statistical analysis of a real-world phenomenon.\n\n## Examples of data analyses in practice\n\n::: incremental\n-   [New Yorkers Will Pay \\$56 A Month To Trim A Minute Off Their Commute](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorkers-will-pay-56-a-month-to-trim-a-minute-off-their-commute/)\n-   [How FiveThirtyEight's 2020 Presidential Forecast Works --- And What's Different Because Of COVID-19](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/)\n-   [Effect of Forensic Evidence on Criminal Justice Case Processing](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12020)\n-   [Why it's so freaking hard to make a good COVID-19 model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/)\n:::\n\n# Course overview\n\n## Homepage\n\n<https://rmorsomme.github.io/website/>\n\n-   All course materials\n-   Links to Sakai, Gradescope, the textbook, etc.\n-   Let's take a tour!\n\n## Course toolkit\n\nAll linked from the course website:\n\n-   Assignment submission and feedback: [Gradescope](https://sakai.duke.edu/portal/site/779c3ebe-3b88-4bcc-bd01-1813e8396a23/page/aec742dc-2972-4f02-a35b-1dd3315af889)\n-   Computing software: [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)\n-   Introduction to Modern Statistics (IMS): [Openintro](https://www.openintro.org/book/ims/)\n\n::: callout-important\nInstall and download R and RStudio before lab tomorrow!\n:::\n\n## Activities: Prepare, Participate, Practice, Perform {.smaller}\n\n-   **Prepare:** Prepare for lectures by completing the readings.\n-   **Participate:** Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, office hours, team meetings\n-   **Practice:** Solve plenty of exercises;

I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.\n-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.\n:::\n\n## Accessibility\n\n-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.\n\n-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always learning how to do this better.
